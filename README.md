# RichEdit Angular Application

This example is a ready-to-use client Angular application with the DevExpress [RichEdit](https://docs.devexpress.com/AspNetCore/400373/office-inspired-controls/controls/rich-edit) component.

## Requirements
* To use the RichEdit control in an Angular application, you need to have a [Universal, DXperience, or ASP.NET subscription](https://www.devexpress.com/buy/net/).
* Versions of the devexpress npm packages should be identical (their major and minor versions should be the same).

## Quick Start

1. Open the **JS** folder. In the command prompt, download and install npm packages that are used in the application:

```
npm install
```

2. In the same folder, run the following command to compile and run the application:

```bash
ng serve --open
```
